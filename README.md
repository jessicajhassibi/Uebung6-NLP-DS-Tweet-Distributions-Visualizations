# Uebung6

###NOTE:
The best model was created through exercise 5 (within the task of creating 20 random models and choosing the best one)
and then saved in "results/results_uebung6/best_model.pt".
The code for exercise 6 (uebung6.py) then just loads that model.

Visualizations for Task 3 lie in folder "results"
